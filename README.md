# SuperMaulTD

Fast, grid-based tower defense with distinct races, deep mechanics, and crunchy impact.

## Quick Start
- Install: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Run: `python main.py`
- alt: build script for easy building -- installs all dependencies and spits out exe

## The Game
A very early stage prototype, as an homage to my favorite TD games from the WC3 era. All assets are placeholders. Waves, races, enemies -- all modular json.
- 20+ races with unique towers and mechanics
- Some physics-backed projectiles
- Mazing and pathfinding
- WC based damage/armor system (normal, piercing, siege, arcane, chaos)
- Effects: DoT, slow, stun, splash, beams, auras, pulls, gold gen, and more

## Game Modes
- Base: full experience
- Advanced (WIP)
- Wild (WIP)
